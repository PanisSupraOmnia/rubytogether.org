  <p>Companies rely on robust tools to build the best apps possible, but the volunteers who maintain those critical Ruby tools and infrastructure can't keep up in their free time. All too often, individual companies end up paying full-time engineers to privately work around issues shared by the entire Ruby community.</p>

  <p class="callout">Ruby Together offers a better way.</p>

  <p>Development teams should never have to sit idle because of problems that could be prevented by maintenance. Sometimes, the work that couldn't be done culminates in a disaster, like RubyGems.org going down for days.</p>

  <p>Companies shouldn't have to pay full-time developers to work on private solutions to public issues. Ruby Together provides a model where companies can spend more time building great apps, instead of spending time on the tools that make those apps possible.</p>
