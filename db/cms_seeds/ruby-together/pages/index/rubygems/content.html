<p>The Rubygems Partnership is a cooperative effort between Ruby Central and Ruby Together to ensure that <a href="http://rubygems.org">RubyGems.org</a> is funded, stable, maintained, and supported.</p>

<p><a href="http://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central</a>, organizers of the international RubyConf and RailsConf conferences, own the <a href="http://rubygems.org">RubyGems.org</a> service. They underwrite hosting costs and ensure that the service is able to continue long-term without needing any external source of funding.</p>

<p><a href="http://rubytogether.org">Ruby Together</a> provides funding and coordination for ongoing development, maintenance, and support work, as well as on-call system administrators. This ensures that the service continues to mature, grow, and improve, as well as ensuring that everything continues to run in tip-top shape.</p>
